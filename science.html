      <h2>Scientific Facts</h2>
      <p>Moon phases occur because of the changing positions of the Sun, Earth, and Moon. As the Moon orbits Earth (about every 29.5 days), we see different portions illuminated by sunlight.</p>

      <h3>The Eight Primary Phases</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>New Moon</strong>: Moon between Earth and Sun — dark side faces us.</li>
        <li><strong>Waxing Crescent</strong>: Thin sliver of light on the right.</li>
        <li><strong>First Quarter</strong>: Right half illuminated.</li>
        <li><strong>Waxing Gibbous</strong>: More than half lit, growing.</li>
        <li><strong>Full Moon</strong>: Entire face illuminated.</li>
        <li><strong>Waning Gibbous</strong>: More than half lit, shrinking.</li>
        <li><strong>Last Quarter</strong>: Left half illuminated.</li>
        <li><strong>Waning Crescent</strong>: Thin sliver on the left.</li>

<h3>Our Wobbly Moon</h3>
<p>When we think of the way the Moon seems to change over the course of a month, we think of phases. But frequent Moon observers know that the Moon also appears to twist, nod, and roll slightly during its journey across the sky, allowing us to peek around the Moon's shoulder and catch glimpses of the farside.
This phenomenon is called libration.

Because the Moons orbit is not perfectly circular, its distance from Earth and its speed in orbit both change slightly throughout the month. The Moon’s rate of rotation around its own axis, though, always stays the same.
When the Moon is at its closest to Earth and moving most quickly along its orbital path, the Moon itself doesn’t rotate quite fast enough to keep entirely the same side facing us, and we get to see a little more of the eastern side of the Moon. When the Moon is farthest from Earth and orbiting at its slowest, its rotation gets a little ahead, and we see a bit more of its western side. We call this motion “libration in longitude.”
The 5 degree tilt of the Moons orbit also causes it to appear to nod, as though it were saying “yes.” The tilt sometimes brings the Moon above Earth’s northern hemisphere, and sometimes below Earth’s southern hemisphere, allowing us to see slightly more of the northern or southern hemispheres of the Moon. We call this motion “libration in latitude.”
Finally, the Moon appears to tilt back and forth like a metronome. The tilt of the Moons orbit contributes to this, but it’s mostly due to the tilt of our Earth. Earth has a tilt of 23.5 degrees on its axis, which means that when we observe the Moon from Earth, it’s a little like we’re standing sideways on a ramp. If you look left, the ramp slopes up. If you look right, the ramp slopes down. In front of you, the horizon looks higher on the right and lower on the left. If you turn around, the horizon appears to tilt the opposite way.
The tilted ramp works the same way as the tilted “platform” of the Earth beneath our feet. Every two weeks, we have to look in the opposite direction to see the Moon, and the ground beneath our feet is then tilted the opposite way as well.

<h4>Earthshine</h4>
<p>Sometimes, when the Moon is in one of its crescent phases, we can still see the darkened area of the Moon’s nearside shining dimly. This effect is caused by the Sun’s light reflecting off Earth’s surface onto the face of the Moon. Because Earth at that point in its orbit is nearly full from the Moon’s perspective, the light it reflects, called earthshine, is bright enough to dimly illuminate the darkened surface.

<h5>Daytime moon</h5>
<p>Though the Moon is often thought of as a nighttime visitor, it’s also visible during the day as a faint, pale presence. The best times to see a daytime Moon are perhaps during the first and last quarter phases, when the Moon is high enough above the horizon and at about 90 degrees from the Sun in the sky. This helps make the Sun’s reflected light bright enough to see as it reflects off of the Moon. The Moon can be seen in the daylit sky at any phase except for the new Moon, when it’s invisible to us, and full Moon, when it’s below the horizon during the day. The crescent through quarter phases are high in the sky during the day, but the daytime gibbous phases can be glimpsed only just before the Sun sets.</p>
